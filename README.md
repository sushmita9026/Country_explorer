Country Explorer is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, allowing users to search for and explore detailed information about countries worldwide. It features interactive country cards displaying names and flags, dynamic search functionality with real-time suggestions, and dedicated details pages for each country showcasing key information such as capital, population, and languages. Users can filter countries by language and region, mark favorites stored in local storage, and enjoy a responsive design optimized for various devices. The application runs smoothly on major web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari, ensuring a consistent user experience. The project includes unit tests to verify functionality, particularly around API interactions, and I faced challenges such as API rate limiting and responsive design adjustments, which were successfully addressed. Overall, this project reflects my skills in front-end development and design thinking, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
